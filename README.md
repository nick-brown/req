Backbone - Marionette - RequireJS
=================================

Base project for Backbone / Marionette loaded using RequireJS


Install
=======

You'll need [bower](http://bower.io/) to get the packages.  

After that's installed, enter your project directory and run `bower install` to install dependencies.  Sudo may be necessary if you get a permissions error.


Mustache Templating
===================

Mustache can be a little tricky to integrate with Marionette due to the default use of underscore templates.  You can find a version using Mustache in addition to the other libraries in the [Mustache branch](https://github.com/nick-brown/req/tree/mustache).
